# Further possibilities

Based on this structure, it should be fairly easy to later add more functionality to the platform. This could be how to transfer GGO between sectors, append more meta data or other possibilities.

A [environmental module]() is currently in the works, where we use data from the environmental and electricity declarations in Denmark to make an hourly electricity declaration based on the data from the GGOs with an hourly  residual mix based on the same dataset as the current declarations.

A [forecast module]() is also on the drawing-boards, this will enable producers, resellers and consumers to share information about production, consumption and available GGOs ahead of the actual issuing of the GGOs. The hope is to enable a balancing of renewable energy.
